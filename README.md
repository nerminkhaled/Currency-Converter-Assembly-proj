# Currency-Converter-Assembly-proj

A simple assembly program to convert between USD, AED, EUR, and EGP — and vice versa.

## 📝 Overview

This project implements a command-line currency converter in Assembly. It allows a user to convert amounts between four currencies: USD, AED, EUR, and EGP. It’s useful as a small exercise in Assembly programming and demonstrates basic input/output, arithmetic, and control flow in Assembly.

## 💡 Features
